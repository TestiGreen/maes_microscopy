Us, and the Licensed Materials are protected under copyright and other Intellectual Property Rights
owned or controlled by Us. We own and retain ownership of all Our Intellectual Property Rights,
including all rights, title, and interests in and to the Licensed Materials (including any portion thereof
that may be incorporated into any Derivative Technology). Under applicable law, Your separate
contribution to any Derivative Technology may be subject to Intellectual Property Rights owned or
controlled by You (“Arising Intellectual Property Rights”).
        All rights not expressly granted to You herein are reserved for Us. Except for the limited license
granted to You herein, this Agreement does not grant You any ownership or other rights or interests in or
to the Licensed Materials or Licensed Intellectual Property Rights, whether by implication, estoppel, or
otherwise.
    7. SHARING LICENSED MATERIALS.
        Every individual or entity with whom You share the Recursion Dataset (including any portion of

Us to Use such Recursion Dataset or portion thereof, as applicable, under the terms of this Agreement.
        If You share any Derivative Technology with any individual(s) or entity(ies), then the license You
apply to Your Arising Intellectual Property Rights in such Derivative Technology must be essentially the



equivalent of this Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, must not permit any Use of such
Derivative Technology for any purpose other than a Permitted Purpose.
        If You share any Recursion Dataset or Derivative Technology, You may not offer or impose on any
recipient of the Recursion Dataset or Derivative Technology any additional or different terms or
conditions, or apply any technological measures to, the recipient’s use of the Recursion Dataset or
Derivative Technology if doing so restricts such recipient from Using the Recursion Dataset or Derivative
Technology to the same extent as is permitted under this Agreement.
    8. UPDATES.
         We will have no obligation to provide upgrades or updates to the Licensed Materials. You
acknowledge that You may be required on a periodic or as-needed basis to apply updates to or

issues, or to incorporate new features. You will promptly apply such updates to, or download and install,
as applicable, all such updates or upgrades, and acknowledge and agree that the Licensed Materials or
portions thereof may not properly operate should You fail to do so. We may also modify or delete in
their entirety certain features and functionality of the Licensed Materials, and You agree that We have
no obligation to continue to provide the Licensed Materials or enable any particular features or
functionality thereof.
    9. THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS.
          The Licensed Materials may display, include, or make available third-party content and

provide links to third-party websites or services (“Third-Party Materials”). You acknowledge and agree
that We are not responsible for Third-Party Materials, including their accuracy, completeness, timeliness,
validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality, or any other aspect thereof. We do not assume
and will not have any liability or responsibility to You or any other individual or entity for any Third-Party
Materials. Third-Party Materials and links thereto are provided solely as a convenience to You, and You
will access and use them entirely at Your own risk and subject to such third party’s terms and conditions.
    10. PRIVACY POLICY.
        You acknowledge that when You Use any of the Licensed Materials, We may use automatic
means (including, for example, cookies and web beacons) to collect information about Your electronic
device and about Your use of the Licensed Materials. You also may be required to provide certain
information about Yourself as a condition to Using the Licensed Materials, or certain of their features or
functionality. All information We collect through or in connection with the Licensed Materials is subject
to Our Privacy Policy at https://www.recursion.com/privacy-notice (the “Privacy Policy”), which is

with respect to Your information in compliance with the Privacy Policy.
    11. TERM AND TERMINATION.
        The term of this Agreement (“Term”) commences when You download the Recursion Software or

Rights unless otherwise earlier terminated.
       Your rights under this Agreement terminate automatically if You fail to comply with this
Agreement. Where Your right to Use the Licensed Materials has terminated as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, Your right reinstates (a) automatically as of the date the violation is
cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation, or (b) upon express




reinstatement by Us. However, this paragraph does not affect any right that We may have to seek
remedies for Your violation of this Agreement.
         For the avoidance of doubt, We may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or
conditions, or stop distributing or making the Licensed Materials available at any time; however, doing so
will not terminate this Agreement.
           Upon termination of this Agreement: (i) all licenses and other rights granted to You under this
Agreement will terminate; (ii) You will immediately cease all use of the Licensed Materials, and will
delete or otherwise destroy, at Your cost, all Licensed Materials (including, for clarity, all copies thereof),
provided that You may continue practicing Your Arising Intellectual Property Rights in any Derivative
Technology so long as You do not Use the Licensed Materials (including any portion thereof incorporated
into the Derivative Technology); and (iii) the provisions of this Agreement which by their nature must
survive termination of this Agreement will continue in force upon any termination, including, but not
limited to, Your obligations relating to Intellectual Property Rights, disclaimer of warranties, limitation of
liability, effects of termination, and the general provisions.

term is defined in 48 C.F.R. §2.101. Accordingly, if You are an agency of the US Government or any
contractor therefore, You receive only those rights with respect to the Licensed Materials as are granted
to all other end users under license, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. §227.7201 through 48 C.F.R.
§227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. §12.212,
with respect to all other US Government licensees and their contractors.

directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Licensed Material or any Derivative Technology to,
or make the Licensed Material or any Derivative Technology accessible from, any jurisdiction or country
to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule, or regulation. You will comply with all
applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including
obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting,
releasing, or otherwise making the Licensed Material or any Derivative Technology available outside the
United States.
        Assignment. You may not assign this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations hereunder
without Our prior written consent and any attempt to do so without such consent will cause this
Agreement and any of Your rights hereunder to be null and void. We may assign this Agreement or any
of Our rights or obligations hereunder without Your consent.
         Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Utah, United States, without giving effect to any choice of law provision or rule
that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction and without regard to the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. You irrevocably agree that the
state and federal courts in the County of Salt Lake, Utah, United States, will have exclusive jurisdiction to
settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, submit to the jurisdiction

to this Agreement. If We are the prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement, then We will
be entitled to recover Our reasonable costs and expenses in connection with such action, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees.





         Equitable Relief. You acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement
are reasonable and necessary to protect Our legitimate interests, and that We would not have entered
into this Agreement in the absence of such restrictions, and that any breach or threatened breach by You
of any provision of this Agreement will result in irreparable injury to Us, for which there will be no
adequate remedy at law. In the event of any breach or threatened breach by You of any provision of this
Agreement, We will be authorized and entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction
injunctive relief, whether preliminary or permanent, specific performance, and an equitable accounting
of all earnings, profits, and other benefits arising from such breach, which rights will be cumulative and
in addition to any other rights or remedies to which We may be entitled at law or in equity. You waive
any requirement that We post a bond or other security as a condition for obtaining any such relief, or
show irreparable harm, balancing of harms, consideration of the public interest, or inadequacy of
monetary damages as a remedy.
       Section Titles. The section titles and headers are for convenience or reference only and in no
way define, limit, or affect the scope or substance of any section of this Agreement.
       Entire Agreement. Other than the Privacy Policy and any commercial agreement that You have
executed with Us in relation to the Licensed Materials, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between You and Us with respect to the Licensed Materials.
         Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, then
such provision will be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and such holding
will not impair the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remaining provisions.
         Waiver. No delay or omission by Us in exercising any right under this Agreement will operate as
a waiver of that or any other right. A waiver or consent given by Us on any one occasion will be effective
only in that instance and will not be construed as a bar or waiver of any right on any other occasion.
